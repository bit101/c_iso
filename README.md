# c_iso
Isocmetric drawing library written in C using Cairo Graphics.

Uses [bitlib_c](https://github.com/bit101/bitlib_c) . This is included in the project, but you'll still need all the dependencies that `bitlib_c` requires:

- gtk3, gcc/clang, pkg-config for general compilation.
- imagemagick, ffmpeg for making gifs or videos.
- eog, vlc for viewing files (or set up your own viewers).
